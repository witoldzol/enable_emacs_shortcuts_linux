***********************************************************************************

To get the Emacs key bindings (especially, Ctrl-a to go to beginning of line, Ctrl-e to end of line) systemwide, e.g. in Firefox, you use:

gconf-editor
and change the setting desktop → gnome → interface → gtk_key_theme from “Default” to “Emacs”.

You get the “You Really Rock” award for most elegant solution to my problem. I just spent the good part of two hours on Google trying to find a solution to this problem, to no avail. And you’re solution worked flawlessly, even in Firefox. Thank you!

Running Xubuntu with Xfce:

From the Application menu select
Settings -> Settings Editor -> xsettings -> Gtk -> KeyThemeName
Click Edit property
Change value to “Emacs” (w/o quotes)
